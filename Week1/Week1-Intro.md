# Week 1

Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content.

We will begin the Python portion of Math 9 covering some topics that are familiar from Matlab (like for loops and function definitions) as well as some things that were not emphasized much in the Matlab portion of the course (for example, data types).

In the [Python data types](./PythonDataTypes.ipynb) section introducing some of the fundamental data types in Python that we will use throughout Math 9.  The similarities and differences between different types of objects in Python will play a prominent role throughout this course.

Then, in the [Alternating list](./AlternatingList.ipynb) section, we discuss several different ways to define one specific function.  In particular, one of these ways (the fastest way) will use the external Python library NumPy.  NumPy will be the primary focus of [Python Week 2](../Week2/NumPy.ipynb).
