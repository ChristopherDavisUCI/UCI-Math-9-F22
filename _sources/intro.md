**Introduction to Programming for Data Science**

Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content. More material will be posted throughout the course.

**Course-level Learning Outcomes**

The goal of this course is to introduce programming in Python, with an emphasis on some of the tools that are most relevant to **data science**.  The primary learning outcomes for Math 10 are that students will be able to:
* select appropriate data types (both built-in Python types as well as types defined in external libraries) when performing computations;
* write code which is *Pythonic* (for example, avoiding unnecessary for loops) and adheres to the *DRY* (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle; 
* given an unfamiliar dataset, apply techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a rapid first-impression of the dataset's contents;
* manipulate structured data using NumPy and pandas;
* produce interactive visualizations conveying significant aspects of datasets using Altair;
* select a suitable machine learning algorithm for a given task and implement it using scikit-learn;
* assess the performance of a machine learning algorithm using a loss function;
* recognize the potential for overfitting when evaluating a machine learning algorithm, and how to detect overfitting using a test set;
* write a data-focused Deepnote notebook using a combination of code cells and explanatory markdown cells.
