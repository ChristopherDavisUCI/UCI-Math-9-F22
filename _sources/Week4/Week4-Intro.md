# Week 4

Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content.

This is the final week introducing Python content for Math 9.  In the first part of this week, we will use the Pillow fork of the PIL library to perform [image processing using Python](./Pillow.ipynb).  Our emphasis will not be on Pillow itself, but instead on using NumPy to analyze and manipulate the images.

In the second part of this week, we will provide an [introduction to Object Oriented Programming](./ObjectOriented.ipynb).  This is a substantial topic in computer science, and we will only briefly touch on it.
